🚀 Just wrapped up a cool mini-project!
 Built a responsive web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with real-time API integration to fetch and display data dynamically. 🧠✨
This was a great hands-on experience with: ✅ DOM manipulation
 ✅ Async API calls using fetch()
 ✅ Clean UI design with CSS
 ✅ Error handling and smooth UX
💡 It's amazing how JS can be when combined with thoughtful design and APIs!
📽️ [Shared a quick screen recording demo below!]
